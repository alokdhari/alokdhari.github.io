                <p>Let's go back to my experience of the startup! :) You'll know which one I am talking about :D</p>
<hr>
<p>The first task I had as a CTO was to build a dev team to deliver on the first version of the product. This is usually a case with startups that have secured a seed fund purely based on the idea/product that they have proposed to develop. I am not going into the reason why I had to hire the dev team in India but talk more about my experience of doing so, my success and failings and, lastly, if it was worth it.</p>
<h5>Fun Fact: Hiring software developers is hard, very hard actually</h5>
<p>If you are hiring or about to do so then brace yourself as you are in for a ride. Hiring developers is just hard and finding the right ones is like finding a needle in a warehouse of haystack! It get's even worse when there is a defined budget, location constrains and tech constrains. It get's way way worse when you are a start-up and do not have any existing employees to say how awesome a team you are. </p>
<p>Regardless of everything, a challenge is a challenge and can only be conquered by a plan. So the first stop was to find a decent firm in India which already had existing employees and were willing to partner with the current company. In hind-sight, it is the only way this can work.</p>
<h5><strong>The first Indian partner</strong></h5>
<p>We found our first partner in region of India we were looking for. The head of the firm was a software developer and confirmed his capabilities with the suite of existing projects that he had under his belt. We signed up and started doing the initial assessment of what the work would look like and how many devs we would need to hire. Very soon we started facing some alarming problems. They were not quite up to their words and seemed to not be very serious about timings. The meetings were almost always unattended or postponed. Then there was the problem of software development and implementation itself. I, as a CTO, thought best to implement things in a certain way while the partner firms head had other ideas. He often went on a tangent and did not consider it important to discuss it with me. <strong>While I almost always encourage such behaviour, it is not great when one's a startup and has very limited resources. PRAGMATISM-1/Experimentation-0 🤣 </strong><br><br>The overall output was negligible and we had to call it a day with this one only after a month of working. <br><br>Lessons Learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not look for a partner led by a developer if you already have a CTO. </li>
<li>Lookout for markers like people being late to meetings, not delivering what they have promised without a just explanation and finally an overall vibe about the product itself. </li>
<li>Do a thorough research into the projects the firm has previously done. Recommendations are key in this business. If you can't find any then stop!</li>
<li>Don't try to save too much money at this stage. You might lose a lot of valuable time otherwise.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Partner Number II</h5>
<p>While we were back to the drawing board, I had some experience under my belt. With that the first thing I made sure was to not look for another developer but for another manager. Someone who has experience of hiring devs in India and setting up the base infrastructure. We were super fortunate to find Net-Edge Technologies. The husband and wife team took the challenge by it's teeth. </p>
<p>The factor that swayed my decision was the owner of the tech firm was very technical himself and his wife was a very experienced HR professional. That, and the fact that they were progressive with their working patterns by Indian standards, no pun intended (I was born INDIAN)! They gave value to morals and employee well being. Understood that it is better to hire people with good attitude and train than otherwise. </p>
<p>The arrangement worked like a charm and in no time we had our first 2 senior devs. Both starting on the same day and with decent amount of experience. </p>
<h5>The working pattern</h5>
<p>So what happens when you have to hire on a budget. You can either choose to not do it or take on the challenge of hiring inexperienced devs, designing a framework for them to follow and helping them learn at all times. A framework where they could succeed and deliver their best outcomes. Indian work force, in general, is a lot more aggressive than in the west. The family structure means young people have a lot more time on their hands and their willingness to work is off the charts. The management should be careful when falling to the temptation to tap into that resource. </p>
<p>The devs I hired were in the same bucket and were almost always willing to go the extra mile, which a startup needs more that anything. As a manager you have to make sure they have enough on their plate to do and clean up at the same time. </p>
<h5>The on-boarding time </h5>
<p>Spend a lot of time writing on-boarding documentation and making sure the process is clear as day. This begins at the HR stage and ends with the devs manager. Make sure there is a process for 121 in place.</p>

                <p>Happy New YEAR people!<br><br>While I may be late on getting this post out, it is still in 2022 and only in February. </p>
<p>2021 was delightful in its own right! So many great things happened. So many sad things happened. As the love of my life puts it:</p>
<blockquote>Today is also a day and is as much worth living as the tomorrow or that yesterday. </blockquote>
<p>COVID has had a profound effect on humanity. Probably, along the lines of what internet did to knowledge or telephone did to distance. </p>
<p>Last year brought some personal successes and failures. Well, alright, more failures than successes, but then I did learn an awful lot. </p>
<p>My biggest achievement for 2021 would outright be the fact in realising that there are insurmountable amounts of ways one can f**k things up. And I truly mean that. Making a mess of things is something I now consider art. An art because I had to step aside and see the shit fly by so many times. I fully intend to write them here and bless you with my knowledge. </p>
<h4>The Burnout - Jan-Mar 2021</h4>
<p>Surely, you have read my post on <a href="https://alokdhari.com/burnout/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burnout</a> where I go into detail of what it is and how to stay clear of it. So for the first half of 2021, I was working over 50 hours a week without taking any day off which led to total burnout eventually, for a company where I do/did not hold anything of.</p>
<h4>Aiming for my personal "heights of naivety", May 2021</h4>
<p>Thinking everything will work out and optimism will only took me so far. When I hit the brick wall in the start-up, I was tired, demoralised and very negative about everything.   A excerpt from poem in Rashmirathi (link attached) by Ramdhari Singh Dinkar goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>जब नाश मनुज पर छाता है,</p>
<p>पहले विवेक मर जाता है।</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Roughly translating to: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>One's conscience dies before their complete destruction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was the same in many ways,heading towards a complete destruction. I did eventually manage to burn all the bridges. That, my family and some amazing people held me together before I could completely break down. The ability to discard negativity is something everyone should focus on and it is one skill that constantly pushes humanity forward. </p>
<p>Persevere! But persevere with the right people and you will know true joy. Persevere with the wrong people and you will be 'Jon Snow'. </p>
<h4>Back to pavilion</h4>
<p>Accepting defeat is not as easy as it is. Taking one on the chin and moving on is one difficult task to do but I had it coming. Optimism will never let your hope die, that is for sure. Folks at Capital on Tap were not only nice but also very very welcoming. I was let in through the door as one walks in to their home but after one serious lesson in management and software development. </p>
<h2>On to 2022 - Let's see if I finally start running this year :) </h2>

                <p>It felt like a very corporate decision-making process where I was the dysfunctional arm that needed chopping of. It has been over a month I left the start-up I help build and I still fail to understand why everything ended the way it ended on the very last day. I was supposed I hear back from the company on why I was not being paid for a month after I was already in the employment for the whole month. To be fair, the way things were going and the amount of work there was, I do expect delays. However, here is my side of the story. </p>
<pre>Brace yourself for a rant of a lifetime!</pre>
<p>Sometime in end of March 2021 I handed a formal notice from a full time post as a CTO and my intention was to serve 3 months and so was discussed. Come end of April 2021, I had found 2 opportunities and had already accepted one of those where I had mentioned that my notice would be 3 months. I was going back to Capital On Tap, almost felt like going home after a rough day out. Before the month end, I proposed to my fellow peers that I leave the company early which will save the company 2 months of my salary and I will make myself available when needed to support the team or a new CTO. My decision to spare more time without charging them was fuelled by the fact that I had put a tremendous amount of time and energy into building this product, and I selfishly wanted it to succeed. There was also a team in India that I built from scratch and up skilled each one of them. The company had other ideas and they were unethical to say the least.</p>
<p>Regardless, on the very last day, a bomb is dropped, and it is said that the company will not be able to pay me for the month of April on the day and will be paying it in the month of June given I deliver the promised requirements and given the company has funds. Mind you, this was a full-time employment contract and this was the last day of my employment. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who on earth tells one of their employees they are not getting paid for the month on their last payday? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was pretty much speechless and deeply hurt! More so, because I was stupid enough to trust the company that they will be able to sort out the finances, knowing my financial situation is quite different to all other founders and this would be something that would put a strain on me. The way it was done was so grim that I still suffer from bouts of anger and frustration to a point that I would just not spend a single moment thinking about it. I find writing about these thoughts and experiences help, and hence, you get to read them too.</p>
<p>There I was, on my last day at the start-up, in a meeting of a company with less than 15 people behaving as a corporate. Whatever work I did for the month of April was not going to be paid for until June. So, <strong>I had been jobless for a month and I did not even know about it</strong>, let alone plan for it. I had DD's coming out the next working day and had to move money around immediately. It would be little to say it is shameful and unethical to do such a thing without one's consent. I wonder, had I stayed, what else was there in store for me. </p>
<p>In later communication during the month of May 2021, it was made clear that I would actually not be paid for the month of April at all, not even in June 2021. Not even if the company was successful and eventually made money. In the same email, I received my P-45, and it mentions my last working day was in end of March 2021. In the same communication it was also promised that I would potentially get to know the company's side of the story, but I am yet to hear a word. Again, not surprising at all, given the fact this is how they make decisions for someone who is part of the team.</p>
<p>What surprised me the most is the people and the decisions they made. The decisions they make lives with others and is important for them to reflect on.  It seems the only thing that was cared about is making sure the ship keeps afloat, while completely losing count of how many people are thrown off board in the process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have learned that one's sanity should be the most revered aspect of one's nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of what happens next, what happened with me will always affect the way I make decisions and will always ensure I uphold ethical values that others chose not to. I had a huge part to play in why I left the start-up but on the same note the burning of the bridge started the day I crossed it.</p>
<p>I am definitely not jobless now and working with the people (Capital On Tap) who have been with me through some toughest of times (Baby, sleepless nights, ILR, First House and what not). It is rightly said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the people who make the company. </p>
</blockquote>

                <address>** This is the second dossier of what I have been through over the last 6 months. In short, I left my full time job at Capital On Tap to start something of my own. At this moment, I am not a part of that company anymore. It feels like I was preparing for a marathon and  got injured right before I could take part in it. Burnout was one of the things that I encountered several times due to working tirelessly for my passion and for someone else's dream. I will try to turn to my positive experiences from next post on-wards. <em>😀</em></address>
<h2><strong>Burnouts are real!</strong></h2>
<p>Let me start by sharing a great story. "How to control your anger?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There once was a little boy who had a bad temper. His father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer a nail into the back of the fence. The first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the next few weeks, as he learned to control his anger, the number of nails hammered daily gradually dwindled down. He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails into the fence. <br>Finally, the day came when the boy did not lose his temper at all. He told his father about it and the father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper. The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone.<br>The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said, “You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one. You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won’t matter how many times you say I’m sorry, the wound is still there.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now replace anger by burnout and the fence as your body. Every time you hit a burnout there is a mark that is left on your body. Not even kidding, the mark it leaves is quite horrendous and something one should be very very wary of. </p>
<p>I have first hand experience in what it feels like and what it does to your mind and body. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Now what I am about to write here is purely based on my personal experience</span>. </p>
<h5><strong>What burnout feels like? </strong></h5>
<p>Imagine doing a couch to 5K in matter of a day while coding. That will probably kill you, so only imagine please. Now imagine doing that over a course of a week or two! 🤣 What you end up with is excessive fatigue and zero mental bandwidth to do anything. It feels like you not having any energy or enthusiasm to deal with what is going on anymore. The first time it happened, I gradually fainted and fell asleep on the couch late in the evening and woke up after a good 12 hours of dreamless sleep. I swear it only felt like a blink to me, like I had one of those revitalising power naps but for 12 hours. I felt great, as if a massive strain were off me and this machine of a body just had its oil and filter changed. </p>
<p>However, the sad part is, it happened again. And this time it was worse and sooner. My eyes had red spots and it would get worse when I would get stressed. The burnout was more gradual, while I contemplated on ways to do more work and be more productive, it engulfed my into . The second time, my body and mind gave up again, but this time, I was on the living room carpet and that is where I slept like a baby for about 4 hours. I feel I never recovered from the second and subsequent burnouts. My wife and family was worried sick and the signs were starting to show on my face. Dark spots on below my eyes showing profound lack of peaceful sleep. Me getting irate over menial stuff. Not being able to look after my family or enjoy their company. I had no support from my colleagues or peers, and to top it all off I did not know myself what I was going through.</p>
<p>Most of the times, I merely thought that I was tired, like one gets after a smashing badminton session. Overall, I think I had about 4 different severe burnout events during the span of 2 months, with each one getting more frequent. I only recognised what I was going through when I had a moment to stop and reflect. And I can only wish I had done it sooner. It was like the boils on your foot that starts hurting only after you finish your miles long walk.</p>
<h5><strong>So, what did I do?</strong></h5>
<p>I had some real bad scars from this experience that I bought on to myself. The first thing I did was to promise myself that I will really look after myself. My peers did do, they all had their weekends and anniversaries and dinners. I promised myself that I will only work hard when my body and mind allow it. There are no clear markers to burnout, at least for me there were not until I had an episode.</p>
<p>I also had to do some garbage sorting. And by garbage, I mean habits and attitude. Identify the habits that make you burn out. For me they were mostly ignoring signs, stressing, and over working. A second big part to play was my attitude. I am almost always optimistic, and I am so not changing that. What I will be changing is making sure I am optimistic with the right people and with the right tools under my belt. I also tend to be unable to prioritise my personal life over work and some people just tend to take that for granted. There must be a boundary and it must be set in stone. Set that early on in your when you start a challenging span of work otherwise burnout is just a matter of time. Once I did these the garbage started getting sorted and here I am blogging about it 😄 </p>
<p>I will end the post by stating the fact that one's body is their temple, please don't let anyone think otherwise (attitude) and most definitely not yourself (boundaries). </p>
<p>Please share your thoughts and feedback.</p>

                <p>If you read my <a href="https://alokdhari.com/seeds-and-opportunities/index.html" title="Seeds and opportunitites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous post</a> not so long ago I left my full time job and embarked on a mission to address quite a huge challenge i.e. to deliver an e-commerce as a service platform that was founded on principles of social responsibility. At this present moment I am not a part of that company anymore and I think it is good decision.</p>
<p>The big question that looms is what can I pass on? Here a small brief of what you should do if you are in the same position as I was when I wrote that post in October, 2020. </p>
<p>1. Do the research before you drop everything and go all in if you are not an owner of the new venture.</p>
<p>I missed to do the research and project planning before I jumped in. Silly, I know! While these are challenging times and I happen to be fortunate enough to be able to find another job, this decision would have left me and my family financially crippled. The company could not afford to pay me the salary I expected and agreed only after a few months, which also meant that I had to loose everything I worked hard for.</p>
<p>2. Look after your mental and physical well-being</p>
<p>Before I jumped ship, a lot of my fellows recommended me not to over work and burn out. But that is exactly what happened. I was pushed against deadlines that I agreed without having time to do any planning with a team that did not have enough time to setup processes and establish a fluent bug free culture. I was coding, mentoring developers, designing architecture, planning features and then releasing it all the time. It all boiled down to me and I was constantly putting more and more effort in. I forgot to relax and have time off. Totally did not balance and set my family aside for a while thinking it will be worth it in the long run. Looking back, while there is a ton I have learned and have up-skilled considerably, it was so not worth it. </p>
<p>3. Know the risk.</p>
<p>I think I knew there was a chance this might happen but I still took the risk. The idea of having something of my own still thrills me to this day. It is only a matter of time until I re-energise and do it all over again. All said and done, I think knowing the risk is one thing and planning for it is another. Thankfully, I also had a plan and I had put some money aside in-case things went south, which it did. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lastly, here's what I have on my wall in front of me right now.<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://alokdhari.com/media/posts/12/20210511_234511.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://alokdhari.com/media/posts/12/responsive/20210511_234511-xs.jpg 300w ,https://alokdhari.com/media/posts/12/responsive/20210511_234511-sm.jpg 480w ,https://alokdhari.com/media/posts/12/responsive/20210511_234511-md.jpg 768w"  alt="" width="2257" height="1068"></figure>

                <p>Let me start by sharing my final docker file. The docker file builds a react project and serves it using nginx.</p>
<p>It itself is pretty descriptive, but if there is anything you don't understand then ping me.</p>
<div>
<pre>#First we build the app.<br><br>FROM node:alpine3.10 as build<br><br>WORKDIR /app<br><br>RUN echo "Starting stage 1 Build"<br><br>#We pass arguments to run our build<br>ARG yourregistrytoken<br>ARG someapiurl<br>ARG cdnurl<br>ARG buildNumber<br><br>ENV NODE_ENV=production<br><br>COPY .dockernpmrc ./.npmrc<br><br>COPY ["package.json", "package-lock.json*", "./"]<br><br>RUN npm set progress=false &amp;&amp; \<br>    npm config set depth 0 &amp;&amp; \<br>    npm install --only=production    <br><br>RUN rm -f .npmrc<br><br>COPY . ./<br><br>RUN rm -f .env<br>RUN rm -f .env.local<br>RUN rm -rf build<br><br># I have a custom docker env file that I copy and replace values in.<br>COPY .dockerenv ./.env<br><br># This code below replaces the values from the argument.<br>RUN sed -i "s/#someapiurl#/${someapiurl}/g" ./.env<br>RUN sed -i "s/#cdnurl#/${cdnurl}/g" ./.env<br>RUN sed -i "s/#buildNumber#/${buildNumber}/g" ./package.json<br>RUN cat ./.env<br><br># Just to check what is going on with the files.<br>RUN ls -al<br><br># Let's run the NPM build<br>RUN npm run build<br><br># #Stage two - Take the Build folder and serve :)<br><br>FROM nginx:alpine<br>RUN rm /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf<br>COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html<br>COPY ./nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d<br><br>ENTRYPOINT ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]<br><br><br><br><br></pre>
<hr>
<p>There are 2 files that are very important for the execution to work. The ".dockerenv" which looks like this</p>
<pre>REACT_APP_Dashboard_Api_URL=https://#someapiurl#/api<br>REACT_APP_imagecdn=https://#cdnurl#<br>SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true<br>Version=#version#</pre>
<p>I replace all these values using <strong>sed</strong>. These values are then embedded into the built application which is where I spent an awful lot of time. On K8S, injecting values using config-maps  just does not work for react applications. Using this way also means we can inject values at build time and can easily integrate for CI/CD. </p>
<p>This results in a super tiny docker image of about 40 Mb and runs smoothly in K8S. The load time is zero for the image is compiled and the entry point is with nginx. Honestly, it took me a while to get to this and I really hope I save someone some time. :) </p>

                <h2>TLDR:</h2>
<p class="msg msg--success">Look after your body and your body will wake you up when  you want.</p>
<p>Let me be very honest with you, it was not easy. I am a coder by profession and my brain seems to work better in the calm of the late nights. In fact, it is same with a lot of coders. Go read this post at hacker news: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20468870" title="At what time of day do famous programmers work?" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">At what time of day do famous programmers work?</a>!</p>
<p>Regardless, I have my reasons and they are quite fair. I happen to be heading a team of devs who are based in India and I happen to be stuck in my home in South London. If I start working by normal hours, 9am, I would be bidding them goodbye after the stand-up. So, instead of my team spending their evenings working, I thought it would be better for me to start early. Well, early as in, getting up at about 3:30am or 4am and start working at 5am. </p>
<p>So, we have a problem and a very viable solution. Only blocker was, as I said, I have been coder for past few years and love working late. </p>
<h4>Attempt One</h4>
<p>Let's brute force it, sleep early and wake up early. That did not seem to work for several reasons. Not able to sleep early was probably the biggest one. I was not able to sleep early was because I woke up late. And you know why I woke up late...</p>
<h3>Attempt Two</h3>
<p>Just wake up! <br>So this seemed to work for a bit. For about 3-4 weeks to be precise. I was sleeping at 11 pm and waking up at around 3:30 am. All alarm induced. My body and mind soon started suffering. Body first and then mind, really! The first symptom of my body suffering was, I would just sleep wherever. Sometimes while watching news and sometimes while working. The suffering of my mind was more delayed but when it showed up, it took a while for me to observe. The fact that me and wifey started having fights after 16 years of a relationship sums it up. </p>
<p>Time to find a better solution.</p>
<h3>Attempt Three</h3>
<p>I needed a plan and I had to cleanse my mind and recover my sleep, so I went back to sleeping normally for a bit. By normal, I mean, sleeping before 10 pm and waking up after 4:30 am. I also started a few good habits, like drinking warm tea before sleeping and drinking a massive pint of warm water first thing after waking up. One more bit that I started doing was taking vitamin and mineral supplements. Just the standard multivitamin tablet TBH. It took me about 2 weeks for me to wake up at these times without an alarm, and that was my goal. Wake up naturally with a fresh mind. Once, that happened, it was time to experiment again. I tried sleeping at 9 pm and waking up at 3:30 am another day and to my surprise I woke up only a few minutes before the alarm started poking me. It was partly because of my excitement and partly because my body has had enough sleep. It was pure bliss to see my body respond so well to my mind. </p>
<p>Pure Harmony..</p>
<p>So here's my step by step process to start waking up early!</p>
<h4>Step 1 - Day 1 to 6</h4>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">1. Fix a time to sleep and wake up 10 pm and 6 am is a good start.<br>2. Drink some herbal tea or warm water before sleeping. I would sip the tea with lights off and relax. Only go to bed when I was sleepy. This would be for a good 15 minutes. Love Pukka tea's (<a href="https://uk.pukkaherbs.com/products/peace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peace </a>and <a href="https://uk.pukkaherbs.com/products/organic-teas/turmeric-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turmeric </a>is my fav!)<br>3. Start taking vitamin and mineral supplements. This is only to make sure you body is happy.<br>4. Set the alarm and wake up. <br>5. Drink a big jug of warm water right after you wake up.<br>6. Stretch and do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Namaskar" title="Surya Namaskar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surya Namaskar</a></p>
<h4>Step 2 - Day 6 to 8</h4>
<p class="msg msg--success">1. Try losing the alarm and waking up on time. Put the alarm for 6:15 am and disable it after you wake up. Or even better, put a silent alarm of only lights and enjoy the light while you are drinking that warm water.<br>2. Prolong the time you relax before going to bed. This is in preparation for the next step. </p>
<h4>Step 3 - Day 9 to 12</h4>
<p class="msg msg--success">1. Sleep 30 minutes earlier than you would and see if you wake up 30 minutes earlier.<br>2. If you don't then please repeat step 1 until you get to this point.</p>
<p>If you do get up earlier then your body is in sync with you and would wake your mind up when you want. </p>
<p>I am now very very comfortable with my sleeping pattern and wake up really fresh with a lot of enthusiasm and hope for the day regardless of how my previous day was. </p>
<p>In the next part I will discuss WHY to become a morning person and what positive and negative changes I have observed.</p>
<p>Good luck with your experiments. :)</p>

When one picks up the book on gardening and decides to grow their own veggies or when one signs up to that swimming class for they finally not scared of learning how to not drown. </p>
<p>Today is one of those days for me!</p>

<p>I have resigned from my permanent job at Capital On Tap. Brave, foolish, ambitious or stupid, only time will tell. What I can tell you is this has been something that's been cooking for a while. When I came to the UK, I was taken back by how much there was to learn and how much everyone had to teach. At all points since then I have had people I could look up to and people who were there for me. While I had help but that help was never material, always emotional. That, along with a good dose of optimism has given me the strength to start something of my own. A place which I can call home and a work where I do what I feel is right. </p>
<p>So, here I am! I am going to be a part of a team who will create and launch an eCommerce platform that will be driven by simplicity and will command a lot of social return. One where the tech and team will be inclusive and genuine. </p>
<p>We have also managed to find a great name for it: <strong>Kuber Digital</strong></p>
<p>While the world is in its whirlwind, we have decided to brave the tides and start a sustainable business which gives something back to the society. </p>
<p>Ride along with me on this amazing adventure of mine.</p>

So basically put your mind to ease and watch those horses of thoughts run around until they give up and give way to control and clean consciousness. </p>
<p class="align-left">Simple?</p>

<p class="align-left">Not really. Actually quite hard. It is very very very similar to killing one self by not breathing. GO ON, try it! Not killing yourself but stop breathing for a bit. While you can chose to do so for a very limited time, you will eventually gasp and give up. Your mind and thoughts are similarly entwined. What is the point you ask? Well, the point is to control the breathing for as long as you can. </p>
<p class="align-left">Let's get deeper into this analogy.. <br>One can hold on to their breath for 30 seconds and hold on to a thought for 5 seconds. They start breathing exercise and eventually prolongs their hold on breath for a minute. Similarly, one meditates to prolong the time one can hold a thought for. </p>
<h2 class="align-left">Me</h2>
<p>I have been on this roller coaster to try to meditate and then not able to either find time or focus long enough. This stops now! I mean it! Really!<br><br>Akin to writing everyday, I am going to meditate as well. 🧘‍♂️</p>
<p>Different people meditate for different reasons. I am yet to truly discover mine. Part of me wants to believe that it will address certain issues with my ability to focus and stay calm. There's also a part that hopes I might be able to meet the goddess of nature or fly to distant realms. Well, either way, what matters is there is a lot to be gained by this. Definitely more mental peace. </p>
