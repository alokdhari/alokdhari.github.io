So many great things happened. So many sad things happened. As the love of my life puts it:</p><blockquote>Today is also a day and is as much worth living as the tomorrow or that yesterday. </blockquote><p>COVID has had a profound effect on humanity. Probably, along the lines of what internet did to knowledge or telephone did to distance. </p><p>Last year brought some personal successes and failures. Well, alright, more failures than successes, but then I did learn an awful lot. </p><p>My biggest achievement for 2021 would outright be the fact in realising that there are insurmountable amounts of ways one can f**k things up. And I truly mean that. Making a mess of things is something I now consider art. An art because I had to step aside and see the shit fly by so many times. I fully intend to write them here and bless you with my knowledge. </p><h4>The Burnout - Jan-Mar 2021</h4><p>Surely, you have read my post on <a href="https://alokdhari.com/burnout/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burnout</a> where I go into detail of what it is and how to stay clear of it. So for the first half of 2021, I was working over 50 hours a week without taking any day off which led to total burnout eventually, for a company where I do/did not hold anything of.</p><h4>Aiming for my personal "heights of naivety", May 2021</h4><p>Thinking everything will work out and optimism will only took me so far. When I hit the brick wall in the start-up, I was tired, demoralised and very negative about everything.   A excerpt from poem in Rashmirathi (link attached) by Ramdhari Singh Dinkar goes something like this:</p><blockquote><p> </p><p>जब नाश मनुज पर छाता है,</p><p>पहले विवेक मर जाता है।</p><p> </p></blockquote><p>Roughly translating to: </p><blockquote><p>One's conscience dies before their complete destruction.</p></blockquote><p>I was the same in many ways,heading towards a complete destruction. I did eventually manage to burn all the bridges. That, my family and some amazing people held me together before I could completely break down. The ability to discard negativity is something everyone should focus on and it is one skill that constantly pushes humanity forward. </p><p>Persevere! But persevere with the right people and you will know true joy. Persevere with the wrong people and you will be 'Jon Snow'. </p><h4>Back to pavilion</h4><p>Accepting defeat is not as easy as it is. Taking one on the chin and moving on is one difficult task to do but I had it coming. Optimism will never let your hope die, that is for sure. Folks at Capital on Tap were not only nice but also very very welcoming. I was let in through the door as one walks in to their home but after one serious lesson in management and software development. </p><h2>On to 2022 - Let's see if I finally start running this year :) </h2><p> </p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Falokdhari.com%2Fnew-year-resolutions%2Findex.html" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://alokdhari.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Falokdhari.com%2Fnew-year-resolutions%2Findex.html&amp;title=Happy%20New%20year%202022" class="js-share linkedin" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION] Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://alokdhari.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right"><div class="comments"><h3>Comments</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
