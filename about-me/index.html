It has indeed taken a lifetime for me to get where I am right now and how can do anything but appreciate. So instead of telling you who I am, I will show you who helped me be what I am today.</p><p>There are so many people I have to thank for what I have become, but I will start with my amazing parents. I am truly a result of their hard work and foresightedness. There would not be a me writing today sitting comfortably in a cushioned chair if there wasn't a father sacrificing his dreams or a mother crying her heart out at the gates of a boarding school. </p><p>Then there is my childhood friend, my soul mate and my wife, and now the mother of our baby girl. Without her I would have never gone the extra mile and would not have been so content with everything.</p><p>I have mentors and they know who they are. Really! I never shy away from saying so, so you know! </p><p>There are very few very special friends I have, they are more brothers than friends. We have fought and made peace and then fought again. </p><p>All said, I have been told that I have not changed much over the course of time. Not by looks of course, but by the pattern of my thoughts and behaviours. I would like to keep things that way.</p><p>See you around. :)</p></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alokdharisingh/" class="linkedin" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://alokdhari.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and gorgeous images from <a href="https://unsplash.com">Unsplash</a></div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://alokdhari.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=babd20e2a0a25821e63a0529c9feaae0"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
