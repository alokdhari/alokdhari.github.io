When one picks up the book on gardening and decides to grow their own veggies or when one signs up to that swimming class for they finally not scared of learning how to not drown.¬†</p>\n<p>Today is one of those days for me!</p>\n\n<p>I have resigned from my permanent job at Capital On Tap. Brave, foolish, ambitious or stupid, only time will tell. What I can tell you is this has been something that's been cooking for a while. When I came to the UK, I was taken back by how much there was to learn and how much everyone had to teach. At all points since then I have had people I could look up to and people who were there for me. While I had help but that help was never material, always emotional. That, along with a good dose of optimism has given me the strength to start something of my own. A place which I can call home and a work where I do what I feel is right.¬†</p>\n<p>So, here I am! I am going to be a part of a team who will create and launch an eCommerce platform that will be driven by simplicity and will command a lot of social return. One where the tech and team will be inclusive and genuine.¬†</p>\n<p>We have also managed to find a great name for it: <strong>Kuber Digital</strong></p>\n<p>While the world is in its whirlwind, we have decided to brave the tides and start a sustainable business which gives something back to the society.¬†</p>\n<p>Ride along with me on this amazing adventure of mine.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>",

So basically put your mind to ease and watch those horses of thoughts run around until they give up and give way to control and clean consciousness.¬†</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">Simple?</p>\n\n<p class=\"align-left\">Not really. Actually quite hard. It is very very very similar to killing one self by not breathing. GO ON, try it! Not killing yourself but stop breathing for a bit. While you can chose to do so for a very limited time, you will eventually gasp and give up. Your mind and thoughts are similarly entwined. What is the point you ask? Well, the point is to control the breathing for as long as you can.¬†</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">Let's get deeper into this analogy..¬†<br>One can hold on to their breath for 30 seconds and hold on to a thought for 5 seconds. They start breathing exercise and eventually prolongs their hold on breath for a minute. Similarly, one meditates to prolong the time one can hold a thought for.¬†</p>\n<h2 class=\"align-left\">Me</h2>\n<p>I have been on this roller coaster to try to meditate and then not able to either find time or focus long enough. This stops now! I mean it! Really!<br><br>Akin to writing everyday, I am going to meditate as well. üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>\n<p>Different people meditate for different reasons. I am yet to truly discover mine. Part of me wants to believe that it will address certain issues with my ability to focus and stay calm. There's also a part that hopes I might be able to meet the goddess of nature or fly to distant realms. Well, either way, what matters is there is a lot to be gained by this. Definitely more mental peace.¬†</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">¬†</p>",

The time just seems to be moving on. It has been over 10 years now that I came with 2 bags full of hopes and dreams this island of a Nation.
