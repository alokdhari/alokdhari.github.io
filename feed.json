This stops now! I mean it! Really!<br><br>Akin to writing everyday, I am going to meditate as well. üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>\n<p>Different people meditate for different reasons. I am yet to truly discover mine. Part of me wants to believe that it will address certain issues with my ability to focus and stay calm. There's also a part that hopes I might be able to meet the goddess of nature or fly to distant realms. Well, either way, what matters is there is a lot to be gained by this. Definitely more mental peace.¬†</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">¬†</p>",

So here we are!<br><br>Another punt at doing this, when I finally feel as old as blogging itself is probably.</p>\n<p>So, where are we? I am right where I was in many ways. The time just seems to be moving on. It has been over 10 years now that I came with 2 bags full of hopes and dreams this island of a Nation. I have met some great and amazing people, and most of all, have made a life here. I mean literally.. my daughter!</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">Everything was great until an invisible non-living flying blob of rna started attacking our species..¬†</p>\n<p>That said, I think I am in a good place. Have my amazing wife and a beautiful baby girl, who are always there to cheer me up.¬†</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">Stay posted and in check. Big things are happening.. my life is about to take a very very exiting turn and hopefully for the better. üò¨</p>",
