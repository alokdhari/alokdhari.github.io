He came across the right people, or so he thought, ones he could build his empire with. And then, one of those people didn't quite do as he pleased and so he was made to leave. Oh the politics of being a prince and the trill of playing with the lives of other. </p></blockquote><p>If you haven't guessed, I was the dysfunctional arm :D. It has been over a month and no clear reason has been given to me on to why everything ended the way it ended. To be fair, the way things were going and the amount of work (THEY) had, I do expect delays. However, here's my side of the story. </p><p>Sometime in end of March, 2021 I handed a formal notice from a full time post as a CTO and my intention was to serve 3 months and so was discussed. Come end of April, 2021, I had found 2 opportunities and had already accepted one of those. I was going back to Capital On Tap, almost felt like going home after a rough day out. I proposed to my fellow peers that they let me go, save 2 months of my salary and I will make myself available if and when needed. It was partly fuelled by the fact that I had put a tremendous amount of time and energy into building this product, and I selfishly wanted it to succeed. There was also a team in India that I built from scratch and up-skilled each one of them. </p><p>Regardless, on the very last day, a bomb is dropped and it is said that, the company will not be able to pay me for the month of April and will be paying it in the month of June given I deliver the promised requirements. I was pretty much speechless. Well, more so, because I was stupid enough to trust knowing my financial situation is quite different to all other founders. The picture painted was so grim that I still suffer from bouts of anger and frustration, to a point that I would just not spend a single moment thinking about it. </p><p>In later communication, it was made clear that I would actually not be paid for the month of April at all. It was also promised that I would potentially get to know the companies side of the story but I am yet to hear a word. </p><p>I am not at all surprised that is has ended for me fair and square. What surprised me the most is the people and the decisions they make. I think everyone seems to only care about making sure the ship keeps afloat, losing count of how many people are thrown off board. Well, ain't that a ship I am happy to jump off from :)</p><p> </p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Falokdhari.com%2Fi-was-jobless-for-a-month-and-i-didnt-know%2Findex.html" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://alokdhari.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Falokdhari.com%2Fi-was-jobless-for-a-month-and-i-didnt-know%2Findex.html&amp;title=I%20was%20jobless%20for%20a%20month%20and%20I%20didn't%20know!" class="js-share linkedin" aria-label="[MISSING TRANSLATION] Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://alokdhari.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></div></footer></div></div></article><div class="main__right"><div class="comments"><h3>Comments</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
